# Ghost Hunters

A Quest text-adventure mystery game inspired by *Phasmophobia*.

## Premise
You are a paranormal **identifier**, not a hunter. Your job is to gather evidence from rooms in a haunted house and determine which ghosts are present—before you make a fatal mistake.

## How to Play
- You start in the **Storage Room** with access to investigation tools.
- You can carry **up to 4 items** at a time.
- Move through rooms and use tools to collect evidence.
- Use the **Journal** to review ghost bios and write notes.
- When you’re ready, return to the **Ghost Database Terminal** and submit your guesses.

## Win / Lose
- **Win:** Correctly identify the ghosts and submit the correct set at the terminal.
- **Lose:** Submit the wrong set (the game ends after submission).

## Tools / Evidence
Tools produce evidence such as UV prints, EMF spikes, freezing temperatures, spirit box responses, silhouettes, candle blowouts, and abnormal sounds. Combine evidence to deduce the ghost types.
